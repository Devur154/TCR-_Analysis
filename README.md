# TCR-Analysis using Immunarch

This project performs T-cell receptor (TCR) diversity and overlap analysis using the `immunarch` package in R. The dataset includes immune repertoire data from multiple samples, and the analysis focuses on measuring diversity (Inverse Simpson Index) and clonotype overlap between samples.


## Requirements

- R (>= 4.0.0)
- Packages:
  - `immunarch`
  - `ggplot2`
  - `dplyr`

You can install the `immunarch` package using:

```r
install.packages("immunarch")
